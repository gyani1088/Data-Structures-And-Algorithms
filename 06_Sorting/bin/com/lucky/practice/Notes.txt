Stable sorting algos - bubble sort, merge sort, insertion sort
Unstable sorting algos - selection sort, quick sort, heap sort

Bubble Sort
Selection Sort - select the max of the array and swap it with the last element
Insertion sort - select the current element at the nth position and insert it in the correct
				position in the n-1 element sorted array before it to make it n elements sorted
				array
Merge function and Merge sort
Partition Function ***
	a) Naive (Stable)
	a) Lomuto partitioning **(Unstable)
	b) Hoare's partitioning (No pivot is fixed, 2 partitions 
	are created which are recursed further) ** (faster than lomuto and unstable)
QuickSort
CycleSort -> O(n2) does minimum writes (used where writes are costly e.g EEPROM)
Heap sort(TODO)
Counting sort(used as a subroutine in Radix sort)
Radix Sort
Bucket Sort

Average time complexity (Hoare's partition) : Random pivot and averaging over it O(nlogn)

3 type partitioning
**Dutch National Flag Algorithm

TODO: Heap Sort (After studying heap) --- Similar to Selection Sort
