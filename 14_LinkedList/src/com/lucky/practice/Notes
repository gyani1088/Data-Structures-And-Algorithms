Inserting/Deleting a head or head.next in a circular linked list is O(1) operation

Detect loop in Linked lists:
    1. Add a visited (boolean) object for each node and as soon as we find a previously visited node as next node
        of the current node, then we can say there's a loop ..... Time complexity:O(n) but there's a modification
        in the Node object.
    2. We store the next pointer of every node to a dummy temp node. When a loop is present the next pointer of an
        existing element would already be pointing to the dummy temp node.
