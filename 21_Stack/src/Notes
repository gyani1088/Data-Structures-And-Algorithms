Linked list implementation of Stack give worst time complexity of O(1) for all operations.

Applications of stack:
1. Function calls
2. Balanced parentheses problem: [(a+b)*{d-(c+e)}]
3. Reversing items
4. Infix to prefix/postfix
5. Evaluation of prefix/postfix
6. Stock span problem and its variants
7. Undo/Redo or backward/forward

Java collections gives 2 implementations of stack:
1. Stack (Thread safe)
2. ArrayDeque (Thread unsafe OR Single threaded use)

Similar problems:
1. Stock span 2.PreviousGreaterElement
1. Largest Area Of Rectangle in a histogram  2.Largest area in a matrix containing all 1s
