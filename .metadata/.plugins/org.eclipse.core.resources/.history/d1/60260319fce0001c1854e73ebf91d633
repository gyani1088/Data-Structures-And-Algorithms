Stable sorting algos - bubble sort, merge sort, insertion sort
Unstable sorting algos - selection sort, quick sort, heap sort

Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion sort
Merge function and Merge sort
Partition Function ***
	a) Naive (Stable)
	a) Lomuto partitioning **(Unstable)
	b) Hoare's partitioning (No pivot is fixed, 2 partitions 
	are created which are recursed further) ** (faster than lomuto and unstable)

Average time complexity (Hoare's partition) : Random pivot and averaging over it O(nlogn)

3 type partitioning
